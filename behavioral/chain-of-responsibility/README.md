# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

In this example [SaleHandler](Chain.ts) defines a chain of responsibility.
