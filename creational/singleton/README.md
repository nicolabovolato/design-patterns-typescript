# Singleton Pattern

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)

In this example [Singleton](Singletons.ts) implements the singleton pattern.
